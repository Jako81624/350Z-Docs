# Master Cylinder Adapter Plate
This adapter plate adapts the stock 350Z CMC mounting location (70mm PCD, 30deg off-centre) to the vertically aligned Wilwood/Tilton type mounts.

If all you want is the adapter, send the DXF file to your laser cutting service of choice.  You will need to tap the off-centre holes (firewall holes) for an M8 thread and countersink the vertically aligned holes (on the side against the firewall) as to both mount the aftermarket cylinder to the adapter using countersunk M8 head-socket bolts and to install two 30 or 35mm fully-threaded M8 socket head bolts into your freshly tapped threads (I recommend some blue threadlock to stop them backing out) and install the assembled unit in the stock location.  Pictures are in the repo for guidance.

It is likely that the fit in the bolt holes will be tight.  Persevere, it will install snug.
