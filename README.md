# 350Z-Docs
Progressive documentation for undocumented areas of the 350Z - designed to increase longevity and democratize modification

When it comes to car modification, there is very little documentation for the little things.  A lot of crucial elements have been measured hundreds of times by many hundreds of people, but, for a variety of reasons, ranging from enclosure by private companies to sheer forgetfulness on the part of the individual, these crucial little tidbits are not public knowledge.

This repository was created purely with the intention of documenting all those useful bits and pieces.  If you have anything to add, please fork the repo and make a pull request.  Any additions are very much appreciated.
